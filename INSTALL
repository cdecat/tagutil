Installation
------------

Notes:
    - do *not* compile tagutil with -DNDEBUG
    - At the time of writting, tagutil need a BSD Make (and maybe a bit of
      hacking) to build if you're not running FreeBSD.

Dependencies:
    - pkg-config (build dep)
    - libyaml

make options:
    WITH_FLAC
        If you want the flac files to be handled by libFLAC.
    WITH_OGGVORBIS
        If you want the ogg/vorbis files to be handled by libvorbis.
    WITH_MPEG3
        If you want the mp3 files handled by ID3Lib.
    WITH_TAGLIB
        generic backend. Can handle a lot of different file type, but only a
        limited set of tags (artist, title, album, tracknumber, date, genre and
        comment)
    DEBUG
        build tagutil with debug symbols (-g compiler option) and warnings.

Optionals Dependencies:
    - WITH_FLAC: libFLAC
    - WITH_OGGVORBIS: libvorbis
    - WITH_MPEG3: ID3Lib, GNU gperf (>=3.0.3, build dep)
    - WITH_TAGLIB: TagLib (>=1.5)

to build and install tagutil, type (for example):
    make WITH_FLAC=y WITH_OGGVORBIS=y DEBUG=y
    make install
