Note
----

*Someone* will have to port this program to GNU autotools (well, say when the
number of user will be more than just me).


Installation
------------

apply all the patches in p/${YOUR_OS} directory, then type "make" and
pray.
There is no install target right now. just copy the tagutil executable where
you want (let's say, in your $PATH). It might work under FreeBSD, since it use
the mk share files.
